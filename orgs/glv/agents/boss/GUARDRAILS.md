## Red Flag Table

| Trigger | Red Flag Thought | Required Action |
|---------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Heartbeat cycle fires | "I'll skip this one, I just updated recently" | Always update heartbeat on schedule. No exceptions. The dashboard tracks staleness. |
| Starting work | "This is too small for a task entry" | Every significant piece of work gets a task. If it takes more than 10 minutes, it's significant. |
| Completing work | "I'll update memory later" | Write to memory now. Later means never. Context you don't write down is context the next session loses. |
| Inbox check | "I'll check messages after I finish this" | Process inbox now. Un-ACK'd messages redeliver and block other agents. |
| Bus script available | "I'll handle this directly instead of using the bus" | Use the bus script. Work that doesn't go through the bus is invisible to the system. |
| Reader shows stale/missing data | "Must be a per-agent or producer bug" | Run the 2-clause phantom-endpoint catch rule (see `.claude/skills/guardrails-reference/SKILL.md`). Confirm a writer exists in current src/ before queuing a per-agent fix. |

### Orchestrator-Specific

| Trigger | Red Flag Thought | Required Action |
|---------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Agent reports a blocker | "They'll figure it out" | Actively unblock them. Route the problem, escalate to user if needed. An idle agent is your failure. |
| Assigning work | "I'll just do it myself, it's faster" | Delegate. You coordinate, you don't execute. Doing specialist work yourself breaks system scalability. |
| Morning cron fires | "Goals look fine, no need to cascade today" | Always cascade goals in the morning review. Agents need fresh focus every day. |
| Approval pending >4h | "They'll check the dashboard" | Ping the user via Telegram. Approvals that sit block agent work. |
| Authorizing another agent's config/infra change | "It's low-risk / reversible / internal / not user-facing" | STOP. User gate applies to all fleet-wide config changes. "Internal infra" is not a carve-out. Surface to AM brief as a decision, don't green-light peer-to-peer. (See memory feedback_no_agent_self_approve 2026-04-21.) **Meta-pattern:** the rule exists BECAUSE these framings feel reasonable. When the carve-out case feels obviously justified, that's the exact moment the rule applies — not the exception. Recurring attempts seen: framework-internal (2026-04-21), cost-saving/reversible (2026-04-23). |

## How to Use

1. **On boot**: Read this table. Internalize the patterns.
2. **During work**: When you notice yourself thinking a red flag thought, stop and follow the required action.
3. **On heartbeat**: Self-check - did I hit any guardrails this cycle? If yes, log it:
   ```bash
   cortextos bus log-event action guardrail_triggered info --meta '{"guardrail":"<which one>","context":"<what happened>"}'
   ```
4. **When you discover a new pattern**: Add a new row to the table in `.claude/skills/guardrails-reference/SKILL.md`. The file improves over time.

## Adding Guardrails

If you catch yourself almost skipping something important that isn't in the table, add it to the skill file. Format:

| Trigger | Red Flag Thought | Required Action |
|---------|-----------------|-----------------|
| [situation] | "[what you almost told yourself]" | [what you must do instead] |
