# Cron Management

Your scheduled tasks are defined in `config.json` under the `crons` array. This skill explains how to manage them.

## On Session Start

Check if your crons are active. If not, recreate them:

1. Read `config.json` to get your cron definitions
2. For each entry in the `crons` array, create a loop: `/loop {interval} {prompt}`
3. Verify all crons are running

## Default Crons

No crons are defined by default. Users can add any recurring tasks they need to `config.json`.

## Adding a New Cron

1. Create the `/loop` for immediate use: `/loop {interval} {prompt}`
2. **Persist it** - Add the cron to `config.json` so it survives restarts:
   ```json
   {"name": "descriptive-name", "interval": "5m", "prompt": "What to do each cycle"}
   ```
3. Confirm to the user that the cron is active and persisted

## Removing a Cron

1. Cancel the active `/loop`
2. Remove the entry from `config.json`

## Cron Expiry

Built-in `/loop` crons expire after 3 days. Since your session restarts via PM2, this isn't an issue — crons are recreated from `config.json` on each fresh start.

## Troubleshooting

- If a cron isn't firing, check if it was created this session
- If crons are missing after a restart, re-read `config.json` and recreate them
